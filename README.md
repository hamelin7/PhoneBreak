Gamify Your Smartphone Habits
Developed by Greg Hamelin

Addictive by Design:

Nomophobia, the fear of being without your mobile phone, is connected to internet overuse and internet addiction disorder. 
Smartphones are designed to get and keep your attention. They are addictive by design and the organizations and industries who want your attention will use many different psychological tactics to get and maintain your attention for as long as possible. Have you ever challenged yourself to intentionally avoid using your smartphone?

Minimum Viable Product -  I want to have a working demo that I could use as a prototype and continue to build up the application. 

Highlights of my MVP:
Android Client App - Utilizing Android Studio and Kotlin.
Backend Infrastructure - Linux server, Database for user accounts and API to interact with the Android client.
Basic App Design - Create a global leaderboard and badges for specific accomplishments, head to head competition and create a network of "friends"


These will all be new to me!
(Developing this MVP will be a great opportunity to learn)
(These may be subject to change as I learn along the way)

Kotlin - for Android client and user interface
JavaScript - NodeJS for interaction with backend
MongoDB - database solution for backend data storage
DigitalOcean - hosting provider for backend infrastructure
Developer Controls Provider - Syncfusion or Radzen - new to this, so wondering if these could make life easier, or if they may be overkill
React Native - for developing the application in Javascript but allows us to run the code on any iOS or Android device. Java and Node.JS are dependencies for developing React Native.
