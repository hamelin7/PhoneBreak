Sprint 1 Goal - have basic hello world application running using react native. 

React Native is all new to me and I have extremely limited experience with Android apps using Android Studio. My goal first goal is to get a basic hello world application working on a virtual emulated android device. Once I have the basic hello world application working, my next step will be to add a simple UI button to initiate the game code. 

To start the project, first I had to install Node.JS, a Java Development Kit and Android Studio. Android Studio won't necessarily be used, but it is an easy way to get additional dependencies installed without much fuss. Once those dependencies were installed, I had to manually add several environmental variables which I've also included in screenshots. 

I have all my environmental variables setup and dependencies installed so I can now run the command to create a new project in React Native: 'npx react-native init [app name]'. When I first ran this command I got an error that there was no 'npm' folder in my AppData/Roaming folder. I confirmed that this folder was present but going back to the CMD prompt I saw there was an update to NPM so I ran the update and the command worked. It takes a while for the react-native project to build so I made some coffee while I waited. 

I'm back with fresh coffee and the React Native app build has completed. Next I have to get my Android Virtual Device working so I can test and review code changes and see how they appear in the app. To get the emulator running I will open the android virtual device from Android studio and then I will run the following command from within the folder where I just created my new React Native app: 'npx react-native run-android'. A new CMD prompt will open with prompts to choose to run the app on an iOS or Android Device. I'm going to be focusing on Android development to start so I chose Android Device. 

I received the following error upon attempting to run the app on my virtual android device: " SDK location not found. Define a valid SDK location with an ANDROID_HOME environment variable or by setting the sdk.dir path in your project's local properties file." Doing some GoogleFu I found an article on Medium.com (https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/react-native-sdk-location-not-found-2688c3440aeb) about the same error using React Native. They recommended opening the project in Android Studio because there could be a local.properties file missing that is causing the error. I attempted to open the Android project folder in my React Native project using Android Studio and I waited....and waited....and waited some more....and eventually Android Studio finished getting any other dependencies setup for my project. I checked and verified that there was now a local.properties file in the project folders. That was my cue to try running the command to launch the app on my Android Virtual Device again. Fingers crossed!!! Well what a surprise the recommendation from Medium.com was just what I needed....except now I have a new error to get past. The app launches on the android virtual device but then closes with an error and I receive an error from my command prompt with the error number 4094. After some research I found a thread on GitHub.com and it was recommended to install the Watchman dependency using Chocolatey(chocolatey is automatically installed as part of the Node.JS package) with the following command: 'choco install watchman' This has to be done in an elevated command prompt for the command to work. I found that out after several failed attempts and receiving file permission errors. I tried to rerun the npx react-native start command to publish the app on the virtual device, but I ran into yet another error. I installed some other dependencies based on some info posted in StackOverflow, still getting the error. Tried changing the default port that React Native is communicating with the Android Virtual device, but the issue persists.

I am using a work owned device for this project and we use Microsoft's AzureAD services to manage user profile folders on workstations. I'm wondering if OneDrive synching user profile folders and my project folder residing in my user profile being related to this error. So in an effort to continue to make progress I created a whole new React Native project in a location not currently being synched by OneDrive. Phew! That was it! I setup a brand new project in a new folder in the root of my user account, but outside of the synched profile folders and I was able to get the React Native app to launch on my Android Virtual Device. Now I have a new issue because I wanted to keep all my notes and react-native code all within the same GitHub project, but that folder is currently also synced with OneDrive because it resides in my AzureAD user profile. I think the best course now would be to connect my new react-native local folder to GitHub and then include a link to that repository from this repository. 

Today's goal is to have a running hello world example application running on my Android Virtual Device, which is a Pixel device. I start by opening my Android Virtual Device, then issuing the following command from the root of the directory where my new React Native App is located: 'npx react-native run-android'

When you first start up the Android Virtual Device and run your app, you will see a welcome screen. There you learn that the code being rendered to create this screen is running from the App.tsx file. We will be editing the App.tsx file to get started and do the initial hello world. From there I created a new .tsx file and started to build that new file and include some styling like centering text and changing the text color depending on dark mode being enabled.
